# Industrial Companies Dataset Generation Methodology

## Overview

This document describes the methodology used to generate the comprehensive industrial companies dataset for the Living Twin synthetic data project.

## Generation Approach

### 1. **Multi-Source Data Strategy**

The dataset combines three complementary approaches:

#### A. **Web Research Foundation**
- Researched Fortune Global 500 companies for scale and structure patterns
- Analyzed regional stock exchanges (NYSE, LSE, Frankfurt, Tokyo, etc.) for geographic distribution
- Studied industry directories and manufacturing databases for sector coverage
- Examined real company profiles for authentic product/service mappings

#### B. **Statistical Modeling**
- **Revenue Distribution**: Pareto-like distribution (40% small, 30% medium, 20% large, 10% mega-corps)
- **Employee Estimation**: Industry-specific revenue-per-employee ratios
- **Geographic Clustering**: Realistic business hub concentrations
- **Innovation Scoring**: Random distributions with industry bias adjustments

#### C. **Rule-Based Enhancement**
- Industry-specific product/service generation
- Certification mapping based on regulatory requirements
- Stock exchange assignment by headquarters location
- Subsidiary generation for larger enterprises

### 2. **Regional Distribution Logic**

Based on global economic data and industrial concentration:

```
Asia Pacific (30%): Reflecting manufacturing dominance and growing tech sector
North America (25%): Established industrial base and innovation centers
Europe (25%): Strong manufacturing and engineering heritage
Latin America (10%): Emerging markets and resource-based industries
Middle East & Africa (10%): Energy sector and developing economies
```

### 3. **Industry Sector Framework**

Four major sectors with detailed subsector breakdown:

#### **Manufacturing (22% of companies)**
- Automotive, Aerospace & Defense, Machinery, Electronics
- Chemicals, Pharmaceuticals, Food & Beverage, Textiles
- Metals, Plastics (processing and components)

#### **Energy (27% of companies)**
- Oil & Gas (upstream, refining, distribution)
- Renewable Energy (solar, wind, hydro, geothermal)
- Utilities (power, gas, water, waste management)
- Mining (coal, metals, industrial minerals)
- Nuclear (power generation, technology, services)

#### **Infrastructure (25% of companies)**
- Construction, Transportation, Logistics
- Telecommunications, Real Estate development

#### **Technology (26% of companies)**
- Semiconductors, Software, Hardware
- AI/ML, IoT, Robotics

## Data Generation Process

### Phase 1: Company Profiles
1. **Basic Attributes**: Name generation using industry-appropriate prefixes/suffixes
2. **Financial Modeling**: Revenue generation with realistic industry distributions
3. **Sizing Calculations**: Employee estimation based on revenue and industry factors
4. **Geographic Assignment**: Headquarters selection from appropriate business centers

2. **Service Offerings**: Professional services matching industry characteristics
3. **Certification Matrix**: Standards and compliance mapping by industry/region
4. **Innovation Metrics**: Digital maturity, sustainability, and innovation scoring

### Phase 3: Market Positioning
1. **Financial Metrics**: Market cap estimation using industry P/E ratios
2. **Stock Exchange**: Assignment based on headquarters country and company size
3. **Global Presence**: Multi-location modeling for larger enterprises
4. **Competitive Context**: Revenue ranking and market share implications

## Quality Assurance Framework

### 1. **Consistency Validation**
- Revenue-to-employee ratios within industry norms
- Geographic headquarters matching country assignments
- Product/service portfolios aligned with industry sectors
- Certification relevance to industry and geography

### 2. **Realism Checks**
- Company size distributions following economic patterns
- Innovation scores correlating with industry characteristics
- Financial metrics within plausible ranges
- Geographic distribution matching economic centers

### 3. **Completeness Verification**
- All required fields populated for every company
- No null values in critical business metrics
- Consistent data types across all records
- Proper formatting for all financial values

## Statistical Foundations

### Revenue Generation Model
```python
# Distribution-based revenue generation
def generate_revenue():
    if random.random() < 0.4:  # 40% small companies
        return random.uniform(0.1, 2.0)    # $100M - $2B
    elif random.random() < 0.7:  # 30% medium companies
        return random.uniform(2.0, 20.0)   # $2B - $20B
    elif random.random() < 0.9:  # 20% large companies
        return random.uniform(20.0, 100.0) # $20B - $100B
    else:  # 10% mega corporations
        return random.uniform(100.0, 500.0) # $100B - $500B
```

### Employee Estimation Model
```python
# Industry-specific revenue per employee (thousands USD)
REVENUE_PER_EMPLOYEE = {
    'Automotive': 300,          # Capital intensive manufacturing
    'Software': 350,            # High value-add knowledge work
    'Pharmaceuticals': 600,     # R&D intensive with high margins
    'Oil & Gas': 800,          # Capital intensive with high margins
    'Semiconductors': 800,      # High-tech manufacturing
}
```

### Innovation Scoring Framework
- **Digital Maturity**: Technology adoption and digital transformation progress
- **Sustainability Score**: ESG practices and environmental responsibility
- **Innovation Index**: R&D investment, patent activity, and new product development

Each metric uses weighted random distributions with industry-specific adjustments.

## Validation Results

### Dataset Quality Metrics
