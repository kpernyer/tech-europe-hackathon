# Living Twin Synthetic Data System

## Project Overview

This project implements a sophisticated **Living Twin Synthetic Data System** for organizational AI modeling. Unlike traditional systems that focus on simple message passing, this system captures the **meaning, intent, certainty, and execution context** of organizational communication to enable realistic AI simulation of business operations.

## 🏗️ Data Architecture Overview

### Core Philosophy: **Meaning Over Messages**
- **Intent-driven communication**: Focus on WHY and WHAT rather than just the words
- **Contextual intelligence**: Rich metadata about sender, recipient, and organizational relationships
- **Execution clarity**: Clear distinction between information sharing vs. actionable decisions
- **Relationship-aware**: Communication adapted based on trust levels and organizational dynamics

## 💬 Communication Flow Models

### 1. **Basic Delegation Flows**
**Location**: `flows/scenario_name.json` and `flows/scenario_name.md`

**Scenario Types**:
- `board_revenue_request` - Financial reporting scenarios
- `product_launch_crisis` - Technical emergency response
- `strategic_pivot` - Major direction changes
- `talent_acquisition` - HR and recruiting scenarios
- `compliance_audit` - Regulatory compliance situations

**Structure**:
```json
{
  "scenario_id": "org_131_board_revenue_request",
  "trigger": "Board requests Q4 revenue projection",
  "urgency_level": "high",
  "participants": ["CEO", "CFO", "VP Sales", "Sales Manager"],
  "flow_steps": [
    {
      "from_role": "CEO",
      "to_role": "CFO", 
      "message": "Board needs Q4 revenue projection...",
      "response_time": "2 hours",
      "expected_actions": ["Analyze financial data", "Prepare presentation"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. **Enhanced Communication Flows**
**Location**: `flows/scenario_name_enhanced.json`

Includes three sophisticated communication patterns:

#### **A. Authority-Based Hierarchical Communication**
**Three Authority Levels**:

**NUDGE** (Gentle suggestions):
- Language: "You might want to consider...", "Have you thought about..."
- Autonomy Level: 80% (high recipient independence)
- Compliance Expected: 30%
- Best for: Peer guidance, collaborative cultures

**RECOMMEND** (Strong suggestions with rationale):
- Language: "I strongly recommend...", "Based on the data, we should..."
- Autonomy Level: 50%
- Compliance Expected: 70%
- Best for: Expert advice, cross-functional coordination

**ORDER** (Direct commands):
- Language: "Please ensure that...", "It's critical that you..."
- Autonomy Level: 20%
- Compliance Expected: 95%
- Best for: Crisis situations, large hierarchy gaps

#### **B. Catch-Ball Refinement Cycles**
**Multi-phase collaborative refinement**:
1. **Initial Proposal** - Original request/idea
2. **Clarification Request** - Recipient seeks understanding
3. **Refined Proposal** - Sender clarifies with more context
4. **Pushback/Concerns** - Recipient raises issues (if collaborative culture)
5. **Compromise Solution** - Negotiated middle ground
6. **Final Agreement** - Mutual understanding reached

**Example**:
```json
{
  "cycle_id": "catch_ball_CEO_CFO",
  "participants": ["CEO", "CFO"],
  "collaboration_score": 0.8,
  "phases": [
    {
      "phase": "initial_proposal",
      "message": "Board needs Q4 projections by Friday",
      "timestamp_offset": "0 minutes"
    },
    {
      "phase": "clarification_request", 
      "message": "Are you thinking high-level summary or detailed breakdown?",
      "timestamp_offset": "45 minutes"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### **C. Wisdom-of-the-Crowd (Gossip Networks)**
**Four-tier information flow**:

1. **Influencers** (VP-level) - Share initial insights via coffee chats
2. **Connectors** (Managers) - Amplify through Slack DMs, hallway conversations
3. **Informants** (Specialists) - Add context in team channels
4. **Collective Wisdom** - Enhanced understanding emerges from group processing

**Tracking**:
- **Information Drift**: How much message changes (0.18 = low drift)
- **Network Reach**: People involved (8 people in sample)
- **Final Sentiment**: Outcome tone (constructive, concerned, optimistic)

### 3. **Intent-Based Communication** 🚀
**Location**: `flows/intent_based_communication_demo.json`

**Revolutionary meaning-first communication system**:

#### **Message Intent Classification**
**8 Core Intent Types**:
- `information_sharing` - FYI, context building
- `decision_request` - Need approval/choice  
- `action_directive` - Must execute
- `opinion_seeking` - Want input/advice
- `status_update` - Progress report
- `problem_escalation` - Issue needs attention
- `resource_request` - Need people/budget/time
- `relationship_building` - Trust/rapport development

#### **Certainty Levels**
**5 Certainty Classifications**:
- `absolute` (95-100%) - "definitely", "certainly", "confirmed"
- `high` (80-94%) - "confident", "likely", "should"
- `moderate` (60-79%) - "believe", "think", "seems"
- `low` (40-59%) - "might", "could", "possibly"
- `speculative` (<40%) - "maybe", "perhaps", "wondering"

#### **Execution Expectations**
**6 Execution Types**:
- `immediate_action` - Within hours
- `planned_execution` - Within days/weeks
- `consideration` - Think about it
- `awareness_only` - Just know this
- `feedback_required` - Need response
- `collaboration_needed` - Work together

#### **Rich Sender Attribution**
**Historical Context** (knowing person over time):
```json
{
  "sender_context": {
    "reliability_score": 0.90,        // Follow-through rate
    "intent_accuracy": 0.85,          // Stated intent matches reality
    "urgency_calibration": 0.80,      // Good at judging true urgency
    "communication_style": "direct"    // Expects efficiency over diplomacy
  },
  "current_state": {
    "stress_level": 0.60,             // Affects communication
    "workload_pressure": 0.70,
    "relationship_quality": 0.70      // With this specific recipient
  },
  "interpretation_guidance": {
    "communication_style_notes": "Expects clear, concise responses. Values efficiency over diplomacy.",
    "reliability_context": "High reliability - commitments typically fulfilled as promised"
  }
}
```

#### **Intelligent Recipient Recommendations**
**AI-powered guidance for recipients**:
```json
{
  "interpretation_analysis": {
    "suggested_interpretation": "This appears to be information_sharing with moderate certainty",
    "alternative_interpretations": ["Could also be relationship building", "Might be testing waters"],
    "context_dependencies": ["Previous project status", "Budget constraints"]
  },
  "response_recommendations": {
    "recommended_response_type": "acknowledgment_with_questions",
    "key_points_to_address": ["Acknowledge understanding", "Clarify ambiguities", "Confirm timeline"],
    "relationship_considerations": "Maintain professional tone while showing engagement"
  },
  "execution_guidance": {
    "immediate_actions": ["Acknowledge receipt", "Add to planning queue"],
    "decision_points": ["Resource allocation", "Timeline prioritization"],
    "risk_factors": ["Resource conflicts", "Timeline constraints"],
    "escalation_triggers": ["No progress after 48 hours", "Quality concerns emerge"]
  }
}
```
