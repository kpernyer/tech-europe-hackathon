Industry Impact:
Healthcare organizations report average compliance costs of $15-25M for mid-size facilities. Non-compliance penalties start at ¥10M for first violations, escalating to ¥100M+ for repeat offenses. Three major Tokyo hospitals have already received preliminary citations for data handling deficiencies.
