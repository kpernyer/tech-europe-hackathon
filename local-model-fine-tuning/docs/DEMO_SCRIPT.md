# üéØ Hackathon Demo Script: Organizational AI Fine-Tuning

## üöÄ **The Story** (2 minutes)
*"What if AI could learn to think like YOUR organization?"*

### The Problem
- Generic AI gives generic business advice
- No understanding of company culture, values, or strategic context
- One-size-fits-all responses don't work for unique organizations

### The Solution  
- Fine-tune AI models on organizational documents
- Create "Organizational DNA" that shapes AI responses
- Local deployment for privacy and control

## üé≠ **Live Demo Sequence** (8-10 minutes)

### **Act 1: The Baseline** (2 minutes)
1. **Show generic AI response**
   ```

   Generic Response: "Consider conducting market research, 
   analyzing competitors, and evaluating ROI potential..."
   ```

2. **Point out the problem**: *"This could be any company, anywhere"*

   Org-Specific Response: "Based on our commitment to sustainable 
   innovation and our Q3 objectives to expand in Nordic markets, 
   we should leverage our core values of customer-centricity and 
   operational excellence. Given our recent product launches in 
   the sustainability space, we should..."
   ```

2. **Side-by-side comparison:**
   - Generic vs Organization-specific
   - Show how it references actual company documents
   - Highlight the personality difference

3. **Model metrics:**
   | Model | Size | Time | Deployment |
   |-------|------|------|------------|
   | Base | 13GB | 2.3s | Local |
   | Fine-tuned | 13GB + 200MB | 2.5s | Local |
   | ChatGPT-4 | ~1.7TB | 1.8s | Cloud |

### **Act 4: The Business Impact** (2 minutes)
1. **Strategic questions demo:**
   - "Should we enter the German market?"

## üéØ **Audience Q&A Prep**

### Expected Questions:
**Q: "How long does fine-tuning take?"**
A: "10-15 minutes for most organizational document sets"

**Q: "What about data privacy?"**  
A: "Everything runs locally - no data leaves your infrastructure"

**Q: "How much does this cost vs ChatGPT?"**
A: "One-time setup cost vs $20+ per month per user for ChatGPT Plus"

**Q: "Can it work with our industry-specific documents?"**
A: "Yes - it learns from whatever documents you provide"

## üîß **Technical Demo Setup**

### Before the Demo:
1. Have sample documents ready (different company types)
2. Pre-generate some training examples for quick show
3. Test the full pipeline end-to-end
4. Prepare backup slides with results if live demo fails

### Demo Environment:
```bash
# Start everything
make demo

# Verify services
curl http://localhost:8000/     # API health
open http://localhost:3000      # Frontend

# Have sample documents ready in different browser tabs
```

### Backup Plan:
- Screenshots of the full workflow
- Pre-recorded video of the fine-tuning process  
- Mock responses showing before/after comparison
